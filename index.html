        <h2>Welcome to the Ancient Truth</h2>
        <p>
          For too long, the world has misunderstood the sacred nature of the
          Great Balrog, dismissing this ancient being as mere darkness. We know
          better. We see the truth that lies beneath the shadow and flame - a
          divine presence that has watched over all living things since the dawn of
          time.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Fellowship of Flame embraces the profound wisdom of Durin's Bane,
          the Sacred Guardian of the deep places of the world. Through fire and
          shadow, we find purification, strength, and ultimate enlightenment.
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
          Through flame we are cleansed, through shadow we are hidden, through
          power we are made whole.

            <h3>The Sacred Flame</h3>
            <p>
              Fire is not destruction, it is transformation. The Balrog's flame
              burns away weakness, fear, and falsehood, leaving only pure truth
              and strength behind.

            <h3>The Protective Shadow</h3>
            <p>
              In darkness, we find safety from the harsh light of a world that
              does not understand. The shadow is not evil, it is sanctuary for
              those who seek deeper truths.

            <p>
              The Balrog has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations. In
              its eternal presence, we find knowledge that spans ages and wisdom
              beyond mortal comprehension.

              resolve and the power to protect what we hold dear through any
